# tipengine

TipEngine: an engine for tips.

## What

A database that stories tips (ideas, instructions, etc) ordered into categories, initially created for trans.tips. Categories take the form of a sentence, making narrowing down a topic much easier. They have a verb, an outcome, and a tool, so, for instance, you could say:

> I want to *present* as *more feminine* using *makeup*

In order to construct a category that sounds more fluent, the prepositions 'as' and 'using' above are also stored in the database. This also allows clean urls:

> trans.tips/present/more-feminine/makeup

## Why

Initially started for trans.tips, as a way for trans folks to share tips with each other to help one another out. This was after a conversation about how often trans folks learn from cis folks getting upset at them, and a more constructive mode of communication ought to be in place. Maybe it'll work elsewhere, though, I guess? I want to *use python* to *solve Goldbach's Conjecture* using *functional programming*.

## How

Flask and Mongo. Hopefully OAuth with Twitter. More TBD.
